# Problem 32
# We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the 
# digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 
# through 5 pandigital.
# The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing 
# multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.
# Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity 
# can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.
# HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only 
# include it once in your sum.
